                  Stress can be detrimental to your health. Maintaining
                  friendships, focusing on hobbies, and taking time to relax may
                  help ensure good mental health. In fact, research shows that
                  staying socially active in retirement is correlated with lower
                  stress levels and a reduced risk of depression. It is also
                  associated with a lowered incidence of Alzheimer’s disease.

                  Staying healthy means monitoring a few key numbers. You should
                  know your blood pressure, cholesterol, and body mass index
                  (BMI). In addition, your blood sugar level may indicate your

                  simple tests to help you identify these numbers and recognize
                  any vulnerabilities you may have.
